<p class="meta">The other database called Dynamo</p>

This week at USENIX ATC'22, a group of my colleagues<sup>[1](#foot1)</sup> from the AWS DynamoDB team are going to be presenting their paper [Amazon DynamoDB: A Scalable, Predictably Performant, and Fully Managed NoSQL Database Service](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc22/presentation/vig). This paper is a rare look at a real-world distributed system that runs at massive scale.

From the paper:

>  In 2021, during the 66-hour Amazon Prime Day shopping event, Amazon systems ... made trillions of API calls to DynamoDB, peaking at 89.2 million requests per second

89 million requests per second is a big database by any standards (and that's just Amazon's use of DynamoDB)!

What's exciting for me about this paper is that it covers DynamoDB's journey, and how it has changed over time to meet customers' needs. There are relatively few papers that cover this kind of change over time. For example:

> The uniform distribution of throughput across partitions is based on the assumptions that an application uniformly accesses keys in a table and the splitting a partition for size equally splits the performance. However, we discovered that application workloads frequently have non-uniform access patterns both over time and over key ranges. When the request rate within a table is non-uniform, splitting a partition and dividing performance allocation proportionately can result in the hot portion of the partition having less available performance than it did before the split. Since throughput was allocated statically and enforced at a partition level, these non-
uniform workloads occasionally resulted in an application’s reads and writes being rejected, called throttling, even though the total provisioned throughput of the table was sufficient to meet its needs.

This is the kind of assumption in a system design—that splitting makes performance better—that's really easy to overlook when designing a system, and potentially difficult to fix when you're in production. A lot of what makes systems like DynamoDB so useful is that they have these lessons baked-in, and the folks who're using them don't need to learn the same lesson themselves.

A key little bit of history<sup>[2](#foot2)</sup>:

> These architectural discussions culminated in Amazon DynamoDB, a public service launched in 2012 that shared most of the name of the previous Dynamo system but little of its architecture.

Reading the rest of the DynamoDB paper you can see the influence that Dynamo had, but also some major differences in the architecture. Most notable, probably, is that DynamoDB uses multi-Paxos for keeping replicas in sync:

> The replicas for a partition form a replication group. The replication group uses Multi-Paxos for leader election and consensus.

and a fairly straightforward leader election model for consistent reads and writes:

> Only the leader replica can serve write and strongly consistent read requests. Upon receiving a write request, the leader of the replication group for the key being written generates a write-ahead log record and sends it to its peer (replicas). ... Any replica of the replication group can serve eventually consistent reads.

Like most big systems at AWS, the DynamoDB team is using formal methods (specifically TLA+) to specify and model check core parts of their system:

> We use formal methods extensively to ensure the correctness of our replication protocols. The core replication protocol was specified using TLA+. 

Check out the paper. If you're interested in databases, distributed systems, or the realities of running at-scale systems, its well worth your time!
